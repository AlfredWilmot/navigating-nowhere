# Navigating Nowhere

This set of instructions aims to outline how to setup the ROS navigation stack on a simulated robot in ROS Melodic (on Ubuntu 18.04). 

These notes are based on instructions from [this guide](https://www.clearpathrobotics.com/assets/guides/kinetic/ros/ROS%20Navigation%20Basics.html) from clearpath robotics for their jackal robot.
