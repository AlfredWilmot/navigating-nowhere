# Navigating Nowhere

This set of instructions aims to outline how to setup the ROS navigation stack on a simulated robot in ROS Melodic (on Ubuntu 18.04). 

Make sure to set-up the git submodules properly in order to get the workspace functioning.

1) Install the CHAMP package and its submodules.
 - `git submodule add https://github.com/chvmp/champ.git`
 - `git submodule add https://github.com/chvmp/robots.git`
 - `git submodule update --init --recursive`

2) Install any dependencies as outlined by the package READMEs, and perform a final check from the catkin_ws.
- `rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y`

1) When setting-up this repository on a new system, pull the submodules, run the robots install script, then build the workspace:
   - `git pull --recurse-submodules`
   - `./src/robots/install_descriptions`
   - `catkin_make`

Setting-up the Boston Dynamics *spot* robot using the [clearpath robotics ROS package](https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/spot_ros) for the hardware driver, and the [*CHAMP* ROS package](https://github.com/chvmp/champ) for simulating the robot in Gazebo and configuration files for the navigation stack.

1) Follow the README of the [*CHAMP* ROS package](https://github.com/chvmp/champ). Validate installation by running the SLAM demo.

2) Experimenting in simulation, need to tune costmap and control params for more efficient navigation.
   - `roslaunch champ_config gazebo.launch`
   - `roslaunch champ_config gmapping.launch rviz:=true`

3) Installed the [spot config folder](https://github.com/chvmp/robots/tree/master/configs/spot_config) by following the instructions on the [*CHAMP* robots repo](https://github.com/chvmp/robots.git). Running SLAM in simulation with spot is set-up as follows:
   - `roslaunch spot_config gazebo.launch`
   - `roslaunch spot_config slam.launch rviz:=true`

## Notes

Clear costmap: 
- `rosservice call /move_base/clear_costmaps`
Reset model poses in Gazebo:
- `Ctrl+Shift+R`
