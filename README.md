# Navigating Nowhere

This set of instructions aims to outline how to setup the ROS navigation stack on a simulated robot in ROS Melodic (on Ubuntu 18.04). 

Here I am following the tutorial outlined in Ch.10 of the book [*ROS Robotics Projects*](https://www.amazon.com/ROS-Robotics-Projects-Ramkumar-Gandhinathan/dp/1838645195), authored by Ramkumar Gandhinathan & Lentin Joseph.

Overview:
- software architecture of a "typical self-driving car"
- simulating and interfacing relevant sensors in ROS/ Gazebo
- Simulation of a "Drive By Wire" (DBW) car in ROS.
